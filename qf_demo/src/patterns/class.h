/*
 * Class Pattern
 *
 * Intent: A multiple instance container that have one single objective,
 *  to avoid coupling between implementation and client code and to be unit
 *  testable.
 *
 * When should be used: Every time you need to implement a single functionality,
 *  all elements of the firmware have to be one type of Class.
 *
 * How it works:
 *  Every function takes the object as parameter;
 *  Init and Deinit are the Constructor and Destructor;
 *  Client code must not access any field of the object directly;
 *  A `_private.h` header is used to store the private data and a header shows
 *   the public methods.
