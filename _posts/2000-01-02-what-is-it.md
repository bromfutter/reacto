<h1>Why reactive?</h1>

<cnt>
<h2>The reactive engine</h2>
<p>It is a <em>main loop</em>, with multiple <em>Event Queues</em> where <em>Handlers</em> are connected to process events.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754">Don't know how reactive application works?</a>
Complex data paths are simplified,
concurrency is minimized while keep high parallelism and
worst case real-time scenario is easier to estimate.

<cnt>
<h2>Better architecture</h2>
<p>You break your problems in many small Handlers <br>and add Queues between them. <br>This way you will have a highly responsible,<br> decoupled and scalable application.</p>
</cnt>

<cnt>
<h2>Deferred work</h2>
<p>Use a Timed Queue to schedule handlers<br> to be called after a specific <br>amount of time.<br></p>
</cnt>

<cnt>
<h2>Made for micro-controllers</h2>
<p>The framework is lightweight<br> and small on footprint,<br> it can run fine in a 16 bit micro-controller<br></p>
</cnt>

<cnt>
<h2>Portable</h2>
<p>No extra dependencies beside the<br> GNU C standards and a few <br>stdlib functions.<br><br></p>
</cnt>

<cnt>
<h2>Fast</h2>
<p>Most storages and queues are zero copy. <br>Only events may get copies.<br><br></p>
</cnt>

<cnt>
<h2>Extra Classes</h2>
<p>You can make use of available <em>Array</em>, <em>Linked List</em>,<br> <em>FIFO</em>, <em>Software Watchdog Timer</em> and more <br>classes to come in future versions.<br></p>
