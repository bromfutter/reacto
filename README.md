# Project Structure

```
    .
    ├── *dependencies*
    │   │       Only for dependency project, no application code here,
    │   │        projects in this folder will not be considered on coverage
    │   │        reports.
    │   │       All projects inside this folder will be built into static
    │   │        libraries for each related platform.
    │   │
    │   ├── *cpputest*
    │   │   │   CppUTest is the test framework we are using, build scripts
    │   │   │    will download and build it here. CppuTest's libraries are
    │   │   │    created for each platform that tests will run.
    │   │   │   All projects built for tests include headers and libraries from
    │   │   │    here.
    │   │   │
    │   │   ├── *include/generated/CppUTestGeneratedConfig.h*
    │   │   │   This file configures the CppUTest build, it is shared between
    │   │   │    all platform builds.
    │   │   │
    │   │   └── *setup-cpputest.sh*
    │   │       This is the script responsible to download and decompress
    │   │        CppUTest source.
    │   │
    │   └── *lpc1769_board*
    │           I am using a LPCXpresso1769 development board, these are the
    │            dependent projects required to generate a complete firmware to
    │            the board.
    │           Every lpc1769 build will include headers and libraries here.
    │
    ├── *qf_demo*
    │   │       Finally the application code. No tests allowed here, nor
    │   │        platform dependent code, only application. Every dependency to
    │   │        external world must be abstracted in order to have a testable
    │   │        project.
    │   │       This project will generate a library that will be linked against
    │   │        tests builds and final builds.
    │   │
    │   └── *src*
    │       │   Here goes the source code of the application.
    │       │   This is an example project where you will find demo code
    │       │    and explanations about Quality Firmware Principles.
    │       │
    │       ├── *patterns*
    │       │   Empty design patterns goes here, explanations are in the
    │       │    headers.
    │       │
    │       ├── *reusables*
    │       │   Every project has reusable modules, such as checks, logs,
    │       │    FIFOs, etc. This is no different.
    │       │
    │       └── *watchdog*
    │           This is an extended example of a Software Watchdog Class created
    │            to provide diversified and safe watchdogs along the firwmare.
    │           A hardware watchdog will reboot by the expiration of any soft
    │            one.
    │
    ├── *qf_demo_tests*
    │   │       Finally our application tests. This project will create
    │   │        executables for each platform where tests will run.
    │   │       There are test code supposed to run on a platform but not on the
    │   │        others, this is why you have a source folder for each platform
    │   │        and one that will have tests that run on every platforms.
    │   │       Each sub folder of *qf_demo_tests* is equivalent of the *src*
    │   │        folder of the application. It means that, if you are testing a
    │   │        pattern, the test code will be at *platform_X/patterns/*.
    │   │
    │   ├── *platform_dev_tests*
    │   │       Test code that will run only on development platform, your
    │   │        computer.
    │   │
    │   ├── *platform_lpc176x_tests*
    │   │       Test code that will run only on the LPCXpresso board.
    │   │
    │   └── *tests*
    │           Test code that will run only on every platform.
    │
    └── *README.md*
